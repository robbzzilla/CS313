      <h3>Design & User Experience</h3>
      <p>Building beautiful layouts and intuitive interfaces that put users'
      needs first is more craft than art, and we take it seriously here
      at ĠІɅϨЅ. Thoughtful, considerate design is at the heart of all we do.
      Whether you are a startup looking to find your voice or an established
      brand looking for a fresh perspective, our creative team is eager to 
      grab a pencil and get to work</p>

      <h3>Social & Content</h3>
      <p>ĠІɅϨЅ can help plan, create, and publish high-quality original content 
        on all the cool social networks, as well as a few of the less cool ones 
        (looking at you, linked in). We’ll also help you amplify and measure the 
        reach and engagement and all that other fun stuff. We work with a variety 
        of photographers specializing in everything from food and events to VR, 
        up to and including VR of food being prepared at events.</p>

      <h3>Development</h3>        
      <p>Our development team can handle everything from the latest responsive 
        front end markup frameworks to deep backend design and execution. We 
        consider ourselves technology agnostic and believe in using the right tools 
        for the job. Having said that, we do have some favorites, and those include 
        Python and Node.js, and we’re getting into Go.</p>
